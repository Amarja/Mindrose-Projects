            <b>Why is fruit important in a diet?</b><br><br>
            Fruits are in important part in diet because,
            Consumption of fruits boosts the body and prevents degeneration of skin and organs.
            Fruits are easy to digest, and are a proved method of maintaining good health.
            Fruits contain a number of nutrients making them excellent dietary supplements.<br>
            Fruit has important vitamins, which the Human body needs because we cannot actually produce these on our own.
            Because of this, we need an external source (such as fruit, fish and sunlight) to provide us with them.<br>
            Examples of functions in the body that are assisted by vitamins are: speeding up the repair of the skin,
            enhancing the processing of calcium, keeping your liver working at top condition,
            and making sure your throat and stomach maintain their protective lining.
            The USDA recommends consuming 2 cups of fruit per day. The healthiest choices are fresh fruits or frozen
            without added sweeteners. Fruit is naturally low in fat, sodium and calories, and rich in potassium, fiber,
            vitamin C and folate. <br>Some high-potassium fruits include peaches, cantaloupe, honeydew, oranges and bananas.
            Fiber in fruit helps to protect against heart disease and lower cholesterol.<br> Vitamin C in foods like citrus
            and strawberries helps with wound healing and keeps gums and teeth healthy.
            Eating a diet rich in fruit may reduce risk for stroke, other cardiovascular diseases and type-2.
            Fruits contain a number of nutrients making them excellent dietary.

                consisting of numerous tropical fruiting trees, cultivated mostly for edible fruit.

                They all belong to the flowering plant family Anacardiaceae.
                The mango is native to South and Southeast Asia, from where it has been distributed
                worldwide to become one of the most cultivated fruits in the tropics.
                The highest concentration of Mangifera genus is in India.

                <b>Orange</b>
                <br><br>The orange (specifically, the sweet orange) is the fruit of the citrus species Citrus Ã— sinensis in
                the family Rutaceae.The fruit of the Citrus sinensis is considered a sweet orange, whereas the fruit of
                the Citrus aurantium is considered a bitter orange. The orange is a hybrid, possibly between pomelo

                As with other citrus fruits, orange pulp is an excellent source of vitamin C.
